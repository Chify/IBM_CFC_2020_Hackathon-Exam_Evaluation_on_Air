# IBM_CFC_2020_Hackathon-Exam_Evaluation_on_Air
POC to be able to conduct subjective examinations online. Configure the questions and the answer key and train the module for calculating the score.

### Short Description:
One of the most affected area in pandemic times is Education. Students can take online training or online classes, but there is no existing solution for subjective evaluation because of which the Examination counsel is forced to cancel/postpone the exams. There is also a big struggle to organize centralized evaluation centers  for teachers to do evaluation for already completed exams as well

So, the key objectives of this POC is to able to digitize the subjective examinations and generate score based on Machine Learning.
